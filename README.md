# -House-Price-Prediction-Using-Regression-Techniques-on-California-Housing-Dataset-
This project predicts house prices using regression models on the California Housing dataset. It explores the impact of features like income, location, and number of rooms on price. Includes EDA, model training, evaluation (R², MAE), and visualizations for insights.

# House Price Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to predict California house prices using regression models. It leverages key features such as median income, house age, average rooms, population, and geographic coordinates (latitude and longitude). By applying machine learning techniques and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), the project uncovers the most influential factors affecting housing prices.
